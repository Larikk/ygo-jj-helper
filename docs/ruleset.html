        Standard TCG rules apply unless stated otherwise:
        <ul>
            <li>A custom <a href="./banlist.html">Banlist</a> is used</li>
            <li>Tribute Summons require no Tributes and are treated as Normal Summons</li>
            <li>Quick-Play Spells are Spell Speed 1 (but are not treated as Normal Spells)</li>
            <li>Only 1 Spell can be activated each turn</li>
            <li>Only 1 Trap can be activated each turn</li>
            <li>Only 1 Spell/Trap can be manually set each turn</li>
            <li>No Ignition Effect Priority</li>
            <li>No hand size limit</li>
            <li>No first turn draw</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Clarifications on individual rules</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the activation of your Spell/Trap is negated, you can attempt to activate another one on the same turn. This is not the case if the effect is negated. (Examples: Solemn Judgement negates activation, Imperial Order negates effect)</li>
            <li>Tribute Summoning</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Treating Tribute Summons as a Normal Summon is not optional; You can not tribute monsters to Normal Summon a high-level monster unless its card text allows or requires that.</li>
                <li>Monster with an effect that triggers on their own Tribute Summon can not active this effect when they are Normal Summoned (Example: Monarchs).</li>
                <li>Monster with an effect that allows them to be Tribute Summoned with more Tributes than necessary can either be Normal Summoned without this effect or Tribute Summoned with this effect by tributing the specified amount of monsters (Example: Moisture Creature).</li>
                <li>Monster with restrictions on their Tribute Summon regarding amount and type of Tributes can only be Tribute Summoned by tributing the necessary Tributes (that means Normal Summoning without Tributes is not allowed.)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
